## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) 


### What I learned

Mixings are reusable blocks of code that can accept arguments and output CSS rules.

```CSS SASS
@mixin md {
  @media (min-width: map-get($breakpoints, "md")) {
    @content;
  }
}

```

### Continued development

I'll continue to develop with SASS, it was a lot of fun and there is a so much to learn yet
